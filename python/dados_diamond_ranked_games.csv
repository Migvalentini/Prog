There are 3 lanes, a jungle, and 5 roles. The goal is to take down the enemy Nexus to win the game.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains the first 10min. stats of approx. 10k ranked games (SOLO QUEUE) from a high ELO (DIAMOND I to MASTER). Players have roughly the same level.\n\nEach game is unique. The **gameId** can help you to fetch more attributes from the Riot API.\n\nThere are 19 features per team (38 in total) collected after 10min in-game. This includes kills, deaths, gold, experience, level... It's up to you to do some feature engineering to get more insights.\n\nThe column **blueWins** is the target value (the value we are trying to predict). A value of 1 means the blue team has won. 0 otherwise.\n\nSo far I know, there is no missing value.\n\n### Glossary\n- Warding totem: An item that a player can put on the map to reveal the nearby area. Very useful for map/objectives control.\n- Minions: NPC that belong to both teams. They give gold when killed by players.\n- Jungle minions: NPC that belong to NO TEAM. They give gold and buffs when killed by players.\n- Elite monsters: Monsters with high hp/damage that give a massive bonus (gold/XP/stats) when killed by a team.\n- Dragons: Elite monster which gives team bonus when killed. The 4th dragon killed by a team gives a massive stats bonus. The 5th dragon (Elder Dragon) offers a huge advantage to the team.\n- Herald: Elite monster which gives stats bonus when killed by the player. It helps to push a lane and destroys structures.\n- Towers: Structures you have to destroy to reach the enemy Nexus. They give gold.\n- Level: Champion level. Start at 1. Max is 18.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks, Rito Gaming.","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min","version":1,"keywords":["subject, arts and entertainment","subject, science and technology, internet, online communities","subject, culture and humanities, games, video games","subject, culture and humanities, games"],"license":{"@type":"CreativeWork","name":"CC0: Public Domain","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"identifier":["600276"],"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Kaggle","url":"https://www.kaggle.com"},"creator":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yi Lan Ma","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience","image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-avatars/thumbnails/3210935-kg.jpeg"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","requiresSubscription":true,"encodingFormat":"zip","fileFormat":"zip","contentUrl":"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min/download?datasetVersionNumber=1","contentSize":"552390 bytes"}],"commentCount":13,"dateModified":"2020-04-13T13:53:02.74Z","discussionUrl":"https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min/discussion","alternateName":"Classify LoL ranked games outcome by looking at the first 10min worth of data","isAccessibleForFree":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/600276/1078419/2fb3bf6ad60c3f050712e620a3d8bd35/dataset-card.jpeg?t=2020-04-13-13-57-53","interactionStatistic":[{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http://schema.org/CommentAction","userInteractionCount":13},{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http://schema.org/DownloadAction","userInteractionCount":17049},{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http://schema.org/ViewAction","userInteractionCount":161436},{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http://schema.org/LikeAction","userInteractionCount":613}]}</script>
